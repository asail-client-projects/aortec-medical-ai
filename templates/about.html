            <h2>About AORTEC</h2>
            <p>AORTEC transforms AAA (Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm) CT scans into 3D models, combining medical imaging, computer science, and web development to enhance diagnosis, treatment, and education.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>What is AAA?</h2>
            <p>Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is an abnormal focal dilation of the abdominal aorta, a vascular structure, this life-threatening condition requires monitoring or treatment depending on the size of the aneurysm and associated symptoms. This condition may be detected incidentally, especially in asymptomatic patients, or detected late at the time of rupture when it is an emergency and requires emergency lifesaving surgery.</p>

            <h2>Our Aim</h2>
            <p>To revolutionize aortic disease management through personalized, predictive, and printable 3D models that bring anatomy to life and transform clinical decision-making. We aim to bridge the gap between imaging and intervention—giving surgeons, radiologists, and researchers a powerful tool to visualize, plan, and predict with unprecedented accuracy.

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Better Outcomes:</b> Better Outcomes: By predicting growth rates and rupture risks, we support earlier, smarter interventions.</li>
                <li><b>Precision Planning:</b> Surgeons can rehearse complex procedures using true-to-life, patient-specific models.</li>
                <li><b>Empowered Teams:</b> Clinicians gain deeper insights, improving confidence and communication across specialties.</li>
                <li><b>Patient Engagement:</b> Visual, tangible models help patients understand their condition and treatment options.</li>
                <li><b>Research-Driven Innovation:</b> We fuel advancements in aortic biomechanics, device testing, and surgical techniques.</li>
                <li><b>Aortec is not just a tool.</b> It’s a shift in how we understand and treat aortic disease (one patient at a time).</li>
